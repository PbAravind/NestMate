5. WHEN exporting a note THEN the system SHALL generate Markdown or PDF format while retaining formatting
6. WHEN attaching links or images THEN the system SHALL store references and display them appropriately

### Requirement 6: Cross-Platform Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be available across all my devices, so that I can access and update information regardless of which device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes are made THEN the system SHALL sync across devices using REST APIs or Firebase
2. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL store changes locally using SQLite
3. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync pending changes
